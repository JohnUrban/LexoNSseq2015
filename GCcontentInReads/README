Usage: GCcontentInSamReads.py inputSAMFile readLength numN


Parameters:
    inputSAMFile - file of READS in SAM format; assumes no header lines.
    readLength - the length of reads in file, assumes all same length (e.g. 50 bp)
    numN - number of non(ACGT) letters (e.g. N, R, Y) allowed to occur in read -- any more and the read is ignored.
        It is recommended to make numN = 0 (i.e. ignore reads with any non-ATGC letters, which is usually a very small proportion in Illumina data)

Quick Start Example: 
    $ GCcontentInSamReads.py file.sam 50 0

Examples in different scenarios:
    If starting with a SAM with no headers, just do:
        $ GCcontentInSamReads.py file.sam readlen num
        
    If starting with a SAM with headers, just do:
        $ grep -v ^@ file.sam | GCcontentInSamReads.py - readlen numN
        
    If starting with a BAM, just do:
        $ samtools view file.bam | GCcontentInSamReads.py - readlen numN

Output has 2 columns: 
    1. G+C count from 0 to readLength
    2. numReads with given G+C count
 Multiply each number in the first column by 100, then divide by readlength to get percent GC.
 Multiply each number in the second column by 100, then divide by the sum of second column to get the percent of total counts for each

Try at commandline:
    $ readlen=50
    $ numN=0"
    $ samtools view example-GC.bam | ./GCcontentInSamReads.py - $readlen $numN > numGCvsNumRead.txt
    $ total=`awk '{SUM+=$2} END {print SUM}' numGCvsNumRead.txt`
    $ awk -v readlen=$readLen -v total=$total 'OFS="\t" {print 100*$1/readlen, 100*$2/total}' numGCvsNumRead.txt
