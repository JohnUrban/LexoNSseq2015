Most, if not all of this code, was made a few years ago (e.g. 2011-2014) when analyzing NS-seq data.

I am providing it here to help Miiko Sokka, and others, reproduce some of the analyses from our 2015 GR NS-seq paper.

Perhaps at one point in the future I will gather the exact commands used at each step to reproduce the analyses.

So far Miiko has been able to reproduce all of the analyses in that paper (as well as the plasmid experiments).
